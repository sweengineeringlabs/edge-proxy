//! LifecycleMonitor trait — **Lifecycle** concern of the 5-Concern Controller
//! pattern.
//!
//! Runtime state management: aggregate health, background tasks, and graceful
//! shutdown. Kept separate from `Job` so the operator surface (health, shutdown)
//! can be exposed without granting execution privileges.
